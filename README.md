# clj-chess-engine

A Clojure application designed to play chess and get functions to compete against one another.

## Usage

### Play interactively against a random algorithm

* clone the repo
* lein repl
* (play-game (initial-board) interactive-f random-f)

Enter your moves as follow in the stdin:
    [:e2 :e4]

### Play two random algorithms against one another

    (play-game (initial-board) random-f random-f)

Sit back and enjoy the game. Watch out the CPU is going to get hot and the function will never return... :)
